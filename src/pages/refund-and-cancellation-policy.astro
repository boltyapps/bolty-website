        <h1>Refund and Cancellation Policy</h1>
        <p>
          This refund and cancellation policy outlines how you can cancel or
          seek a refund for a product / service that you have purchased through
          the Platform. Under this policy: Cancellations will only be considered
          if the request is made within 2 hours. However, cancellation requests
          may not be entertained if the orders have been communicated to such
          sellers / merchant(s) listed on the Platform and they have initiated
          the process of shipping them, or the product is out for delivery. In
          such an event, you may choose to reject the product at the doorstep.
          In case of receipt of damaged or defective items, please report to our
          customer service team. The request would be entertained once the
          seller/ merchant listed on the Platform, has checked and determined
          the same at its own end. In case you feel that the product received is
          not as shown on the site or as per your expectations, you must bring
          it to the notice of our customer service within 2 hours of receiving
          the product. The customer service team after looking into your
          complaint will take an appropriate decision. In case of complaints
          regarding the products that come with a warranty from the
          manufacturers, please refer the issue to them. In case of any refunds
          approved by Bolty, it will take 5 days for the refund to be processed
          to you
